# Possible Enhancements

ideas for possible enhancements:

- **A Better Way to Override Templates**: Other packages have better, more robust ways to allow template packs to be developed (eg see especially [`crispy-forms`](https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/template_packs.html)). Maybe that would be better here too. And make `daisyUI` the first one?
